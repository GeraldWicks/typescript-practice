/*

So TypeScript doesn’t get in your way. Of course, over time, you may want to be a bit more defensive against mistakes, 
and make TypeScript act a bit more strictly. In that case, you can use the noEmitOnError compiler option. 
Try changing your hello.ts file and running tsc with that flag:

tsc --noEmitOnError hello.ts
You’ll notice that hello.js never gets updated.
